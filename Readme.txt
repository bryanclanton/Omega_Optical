Datasets:
Agent Database - this contains all agent names, agent hire dates and the agents supervisor
Phone Evaluations - this contains 3 months of phone evaluation data (multiple evaluations per agent per month over 14 scoring criteria)
Phone Evaluations Criteria - this is a reference duplicate of the Phone Evaluations dataset with all criteria columns unpivoted.  This allows me to better report on the criteria.
Workforce Tracker - this contains the attendace data for agents including corrective action
Calendar Table - simple dataset containing dates in a variety of formats


Power BI Reports:
*** Work in progress ***

Quality Dashboard - currently working on a dashboard to show the phone evaluation quality for all agents.  Will have a basic overview tab, supervisor/team overview tab and a tab that drills furter down to the individual agents

Future Power BI Reports
Worforce Tracker report - focuses on attendance and corrective action
Agent Review report - a report that contains quality, attendance and corrective action items to be used for monthly agent reviews
